# HUMCHILD - VIDEO ART

Hum Child (2012) - man's journey and struggle through a universe of noise and distraction.
/ narrative feature length or short film

Originally made by Rhizoma Narrative (previous company entity).

Project that was supposed to be a film. You see, I don't know even know how my voice sounds. I don't hear in so many ways. I don't listen, I don't notice things. I am free. Am I free? And then there is this… Something that comes along. It's beautiful. I can feel it, it vibrates within me. (the music begins) (hybrid music, a type a deaf person would hear). Beginning: Slow mo of the kid and parents shouting behind his back. Him sitting in an empty bright room. We see his naked back, he puts on a shirt or sweater as of shielding himself from the world.

Levels of meaning.
1. Deaf in literal sense.
2. Deaf as in oblivious to the unnecessary noise of the world. Peace of the mind.
3. Deaf as being ignorant of others in whatever way.
